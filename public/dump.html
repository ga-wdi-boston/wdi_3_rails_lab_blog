<h2>Getting set up in Rails</h2>
<p>This is my first blog post from my rails application, using the wysiwyg editor <a href="https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-rails">from Froala.</a> I used the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Rails documentation Getting Started guide</a>.</p>

<h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
<p>First half of today's class focused on HTML and CSS basics during which I created a tagging structure on my rails blog. Corrine and I worked together, the lab involved sketching a wireframe of a website and having another pair code the wireframes. Rebecca and Holly coded our mockups, we coded their mockups, then we went to lunch.</p>

<h2>Intro to Rails</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Created a new Rails project: <code>rails new FirstApp</code> with this appended on the end: "--database=postgresql"</li>

  <li>Created new database with <code>rake db:create</code></li>

  <li>Added a route to config/routes.rb of get <code>'welcome' =&gt; 'welcome#show'</code></li>

  <li>View routes in terminal with <code>rake routes</code></li>

  <li>Created a new controller and associated files with a rails generator : <code>bin/rails generate controller welcome</code></li>

  <li>Create a controller action called show in app/controller/welcome_controller.rb</li>

  <li>Created a view template in app/views/welcome/show.html.erb</li>

  <li>Ran the Rails server by running rails server from the bash prompt, which we can close with CTRL-C</li>

  <li>View page in Chrome at http://localhost:3000/welcome</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rails!! Hooray!</h2>
<p>Keep track of your questions. David might say "not today" but it's not because he's hiding things. It's more about he might cover that topic at a later date.</p>

<h2>Routes</h2>

<p>The first thing that happens when you make a request on a rails app is Routing. The router takes the HTTP request (url & method) directs to proper Controller and Method.</p>

<h2>Controller</h2>

<p>The controller's purpose is to deal with user input, and the user input comes in as params. Then the controller interacts with the model. Then the controller interacts with view, returning the view instance variables of the model.</p>

<h2>Model</h2>

<p>The models are object representations of the data base schema. It provides behavior and rules for the data. The model is all about data. Doesn't know anything about html, css, erb files, views, input from the controller, it just knows about its data. The model ties into the database.</p>

<h2>View</h2>

<p>The view mixes data together from the controller with html, rendering out the information sent from the controller. Also for creating forms that can make more requests.</p>

<h2>Migrations</h2>

<p>Migrations change the structure of the database. They are not triggered by HTTP requests (they are run manually).</p>
<hr>
<h2>The HTTP requests go like this with Rails app:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Browser makes GET request to the server</li>

  <li>Routes look at URL + HTTP method direct to matching controller and action</li>

  <li>Controller action                                                                                                                                    
    <ul>
      <li>Take optional user input from params</li>

      <li>Use the model to query the database with user input</li>

      <li>Store data in @instance variable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Name matching ERB view: compile/render info from @instance variables into HTML</li>

  <li>End of controller action returns the rendered HTML as a response. </li>

  <li>Browser displays HTML</li>
</ol>

<h2>Rails migrations</h2>

<p><code>rails g migration CreateBooks title author_name price:decimal</code> creates a new table on your database called Books</p>

<p><code>rake db:migrate</code> runs the migration (adds the new table `Books`</p>

<p><code>rails g migration AddNumberOfPagesAndLanguageToBooks num_pages:integer language:string</code> adds two new columns called num_pages which takes an integer, and language, which takes a string.</p>

<p><code>rake db:migrate</code> to apply the migration (actually adds the columns to the tables)</p>

<p><code>rake db:rollback</code> rolls back your migration by one migration</p>

<p><br></p>

<pre><code>class CreateBooks
def change
    create_table :books do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :author #=&gt; added in after creating the initial migration table
      t.date :pub_date #=&gt; added in after creating the initial migration table
      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>by rolling back before your initial migration, you can alter the original schema in your ruby file.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><code>rake db:migrate</code> to apply your changes to your db</p>

<h2>Models</h2>

<p>Models inherits from <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>. Upon creation models will be generated as empty. </p>

<p>By adding in <code>gem 'pry-rails'</code> in your Gemfile, you can use pry in the Rails console by calling <code>rails (c)onsole</code></p>
